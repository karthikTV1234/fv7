üéØ Your goal:
You want to know if a new screen(new instance) is created every time you switch tabs.


class BottomNavigation extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Widget> screens = [
    HomeScreen(),
    EntriesScreen(),
    AnalysisScreen(),
  ];

Then you use:
body: screens[currentIndex],

‚ùì So what happens when you switch tabs?
‚û°Ô∏è Flutter does not create new widgets.
 1. Because screens is created once at the top.
 2. It reuses the same widgets every time.

Observations:
 1. Everytime on moving to another tab and come back, same instance.


New widget/Instance every time?
Just move the list(below one) inside the build() method.
final List<Widget> screens = [
    HomeScreen(),
    EntriesScreen(),
    AnalysisScreen(),
  ];

Observations:
 1. Everytime on moving to another tab and come back, new instance.
