What is Dark Mode / Light Mode in Flutter?
In Flutter, themes allow you to change how your app looks â€” like background color, text color, icon color, etc.
You can create two themes:
 1. Light Theme (for daytime usage)
 2. Dark Theme (for night/dark environments)


Why Dark Mode?
Reduced Eye Strain: Dark backgrounds are easier on the eyes, especially in low-light environments.
Battery Efficiency: 
 1. Dark mode can extend battery life by reducing screen energy consumption
Improved Aesthetics: Many users prefer dark themes for a cleaner, modern look.
