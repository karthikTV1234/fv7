Why Do Tools for Monitoring Memory comes into pitcure?
Why we need Tools, What problems Tools will solve?

1. Detect Memory Leaks
   1. 🔍 Identify objects that stay in memory even after they’re no longer needed
   2. 🧹 Helps detect parts of the app that are not cleaned up properly, like forgotten controllers or subscriptions
 
2. Monitor Memory Usage Over Time
   1. 📈 Track how memory usage increases as the app runs
   2. 🐢 Helps catch gradual memory growth (called “memory creep”) which can slow down the app over time

3. Analyze Garbage Collection (GC)
   1. ♻️ Observe when Garbage Collection occurs and whether unused memory is being released
   2. 🔁 Frequent GC may indicate inefficient memory use

4. Compare Memory Snapshots
   1. 📸 Take snapshots of memory at different times
   2. 🔍 Compare snapshots to find which objects grew in number or size, helping detect leaks or incorrect usage


📦 Without Tools:
You're guessing what’s wrong.

⚙️ With Tools:
You’re using real data and visual insights to identify, debug, and optimize memory usage smartly.
