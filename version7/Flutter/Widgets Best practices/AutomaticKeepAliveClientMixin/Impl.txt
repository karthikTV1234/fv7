1. Your widget must be a StatefulWidget.
2. In the State class, add the mixin like this:
class _EntriesScreenState extends State<EntriesScreen> with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin {
  @override
  bool get wantKeepAlive => true;
3. Override wantKeepAlive method
This tells Flutter: “Keep this widget alive even when it’s not visible.”
4. In your build method, call super.build(context);


🎯 When do you need this?
When EntriesScreen is inside TabBarView or PageView.

If you notice the list reloads or resets scroll when switching tabs.
