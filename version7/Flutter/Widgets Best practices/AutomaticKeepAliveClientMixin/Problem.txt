Imagine you have an app with tabs — like this:
[ Tab 1 | Tab 2 | Tab 3 ]

Each tab has a list of items.
When you:
 1. Scroll Tab 1 down a bit
 2. Switch to Tab 2
 3. Come back to Tab 1

👉 Uh-oh! Scroll position is gone!
It starts from the top again 😬


❓ Why does this happen?
Because Flutter removes (disposes) the page when it's not visible, to save memory.
