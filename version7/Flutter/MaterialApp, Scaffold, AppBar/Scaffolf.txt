✅ What is Scaffold?
A ready-made screen layout in Flutter.
It helps structure your app screen with:
  1. appBar – Top bar
  2. body – Main content
  3. floatingActionButton – Circular action button
  4. drawer – Side menu
  5. bottomNavigationBar – Bottom tabs


🧠 When to Use:
Use Scaffold when your screen needs:
 1. A top AppBar
 2. A body for content
 3. A Floating Action Button
 4. A Drawer menu
 5. A Bottom Navigation Bar
✅ Common in almost every app screen.

❌ When NOT to Use:
Don’t use Scaffold if:
  1. You’re building a custom full-screen (like a splash screen).
  2. You don’t need appBar, FAB, drawer, etc.


Example: You need an AppBar (Top bar)
If your screen needs a title bar at the top, maybe with actions like search or settings, use Scaffold.
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text("Dashboard"),
    actions: [Icon(Icons.search)],
  ),
  body: ...
)

Scaffold(
  appBar: 🟦 The Roof + Name Plate
  drawer: 🟥 Side Cabinet (Menu)
  body: 🟩 Living Room (Main screen)
  floatingActionButton: 🟨 Button next to sofa
  bottomNavigationBar: ⬛ Floor with quick switches (rooms)
)
