Limitations:
❌ Limitations of InkWell
1. Needs a Material Ancestor
Problem: InkWell only works inside a Material widget (like Card, Scaffold, or manually wrapping with Material).
If you forget this, the ripple effect won’t appear.

2. Limited Gesture Support
Only supports tap, double tap, long press, and hover.

❌ No support for gestures like:

Swipe

Pan/Drag

Pinch/Zoom
