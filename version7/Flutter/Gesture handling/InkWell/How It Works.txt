🧐 How It Works
1. Listens to Bloc State
   Uses BlocBuilder<DataEntryBloc, DataEntryState> to get the selected date from the state.

2. Opens Date Picker Dialog
   showDatePicker() is triggered when the user taps the widget.

3. Updates the Bloc State
   When a date is selected, we dispatch a DateChanged event to update the state.

4. Displays the Selected Date
   The selected date is formatted using DateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd') and displayed.
