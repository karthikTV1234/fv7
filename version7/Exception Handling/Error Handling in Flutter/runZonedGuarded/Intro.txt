What is runZonedGuarded?
Flutter doesnâ€™t catch errors from Futures or async code automatically â€” that's where runZonedGuarded helps.

Syntax:
runZonedGuarded(
  () {
    // Run your Flutter app
    runApp(MyApp());
  },
  (error, stackTrace) {
    // Handle uncaught errors here
    print('Caught async error: $error');
  },
);


ðŸ§  Why Do We Need This?
By default:
 1. Flutter catches sync widget errors (e.g., build() errors) using FlutterError.onError.
 2. But async errors (e.g., inside Future, async/await, timers) might crash the app if not caught manually.
