what it is, when it’s used, and how to customize it to show a nice fallback UI when something goes wrong in the widget tree.

What is ErrorWidget in Flutter?
In Flutter, if a widget throws an error during the build phase, Flutter shows a red screen with an error message like:
Oops! Unexpected error occurred.


Why Use ErrorWidget.builder?
You can customize this default red screen using ErrorWidget.builder, so that:
  1. The app doesn’t crash or look broken
  2. You can show a friendly UI like “Something went wrong”
  3. Optionally log the error


Where to place ErrorWidget.builder?
No, you do NOT need to write ErrorWidget.builder in every widget.
You just define it once globally (usually in main()), and Flutter will use it whenever any widget throws an error during the build phase.


🔍 Notes
1. ErrorWidget.builder only handles errors in the widget build phase.
2. It won’t catch:
 1. Async errors
 2. Logic errors outside widgets
