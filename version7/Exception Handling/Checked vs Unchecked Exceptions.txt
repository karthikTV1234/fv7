Java
 1. Java has checked exceptions (like IOException) that must be caught or declared using throws.

Example:
void readFile() throws IOException {
   // code
}

Dart
 1. Dart does not have checked exceptions. You don't need to declare throws, and the compiler wonâ€™t force you to catch exceptions.
