Java:
try {
    // risky code
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup");
}

Dart:
try {
  // risky code
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
} finally {
  print('Cleanup');
}

✔️ Similarities: Both use try, catch, and finally.
✔️ Differences:
   1. Dart doesn't need to declare the type of exception in catch.
   2. In Dart, you can catch with or without a type.
