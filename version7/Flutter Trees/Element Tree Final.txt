1. The element tree is an internal representation of the widget tree that Flutter uses for rendering.


What is "Rendering"?
Rendering means:
  "Drawing the UI on the screen"

In Flutter (or any UI framework), rendering is the process of:
 1. Taking your code (Widget Tree)
 2. Figuring out what should appear on screen
 3. And finally, painting that on the display â€” text, buttons, images, layout, etc.


2. The element tree is created from the widget tree during the widget build process.
