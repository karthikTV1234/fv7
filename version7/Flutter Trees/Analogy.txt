Widget Tree – The Planner (🐷 1st Pig):
 1. This is your code.
 2. Just a blueprint or description of what UI should look like.
 3. Stateless and immutable – doesn't know what’s already on screen.
 4. Created fresh every time the UI updates.


🏗️ 2. Element Tree – The Organizer (🐷 2nd Pig)
 1. Connects the Widget Tree with the Render Tree.
 2. Knows what’s already built and manages updates.
 3. Creates, updates, and reuses widgets smartly.
 4. Holds a reference to both:
    1. The Widget
    2. The Render Object

✅ First time: Builds everything
✅ Next updates: Reuses and updates only changed parts


🎨 3. Render Object Tree – The Builder (🐷 3rd Pig)
  1. Actually paints and lays out the UI on the screen.
  2. Gets instructions from the Element Tree.
  3. Handles:
     1. Size
     2. Position
     3. Drawing
