In Flutter, rendering an app on the screen involves three different trees.

1. Widget Tree
2. Element Tree
3. Render Object Tree


Widget Tree         - What you want (blueprint)
       ↓
Element Tree        - Tracks what's built (manager)
       ↓
Render Object Tree  - Actually draws UI (builders)
