2. Download Progress
  1. Show progress while downloading

Think of downloading a file like tracking a package:
 1. At first, it says “📦 Package shipped”
 2. Then “🚚 In transit”
 3. Then “🏠 Out for delivery”
 4. Finally, “✅ Delivered”

Each update is sent to you over time, and you handle it as it comes.
That’s exactly what a stream does — it sends updates over time, not all at once.


Pros:
1. If you want to add cancel or pause/resume, with streams it is easy.
