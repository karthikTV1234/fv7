🕒 FUTURE – One-time delivery 📦
Analogy: Food Delivery from a Restaurant
Imagine you're ordering food from a restaurant:
 1. You place an order.
 2. The restaurant says: “Okay, we’ll deliver it soon.”
 3. After some time, a delivery guy comes and gives you one meal.
 4. Done! ✅

In Dart terms:
 1. You request something async (like data from the internet).
 2. Dart returns a Future (a promise that the data will come).
 3. When it's done, the data is delivered once, and the future is completed.



🌊 STREAM – Continuous delivery 📬📬📬
Analogy: Subscription to a Magazine
Now imagine you subscribe to a magazine:
 1. Every week, the postman brings a new magazine.
 2. You can read each one as it comes, or stop the subscription anytime.
 3. It's a flow of multiple deliveries over time.

In Dart terms:
 1. A Stream sends multiple values over time.
 2. You can listen to it and react to each new value.
